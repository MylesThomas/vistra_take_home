# Vistra Corp - Take Home Modeling Problem

Position: Senior Data Scientist, IT Engineering & Operations (Generation/Wholesale)

Prompt:

Please develop a forecast model using the data in tab “Train” in the attached file.

Column  B – “CF”:  This is electricity output from a wind farm, the TARGET variable we would like you to predict (Y).

Column C to DJ:  These are Wind Speed from different locations (X).  You can use all of them as model inputs, or filter these variables using feature selection techniques.

Model test metrics: MAE

Goal:  Please predict column B – “CF” on tab “Predict”.

You have one week to work on this.  Please send back your solution (in python code) and prediction (in excel file), by the end of 06/21/2024.  Please use Git repository to share your source code (Jupyter notebook is recommended) and results.

What we expect to see in your Python code: exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, training/test split,  model training and testing,  output MAE of test data, plot predictions vs actuals in test set. Please treat it as an opportunity to demonstrate your technical skills. Looking forward to hearing back from you!
